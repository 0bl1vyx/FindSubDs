# üîç FindSubDs - The Ultimate Subdomain Enumerator (v2.7)

**FindSubDs** is a powerful and lightning-fast Bash script that automates the process of subdomain enumeration. It intelligently orchestrates a suite of the best open-source tools to discover, resolve, and verify subdomains, presenting the results in a clean, user-friendly interface.

This tool was designed to be the perfect first step in any reconnaissance workflow for bug bounty hunters, penetration testers, and security researchers.

## ‚ú® Features

  - **Multi-Source Enumeration**: Aggregates results from industry-standard passive tools (`Subfinder`, `Findomain`) for wide coverage.
  - **Optional Brute-Forcing**: Integrate `puredns` with your custom wordlists to discover unlinked subdomains.
  - **Optional Permutations**: Use `alterx` to generate and resolve potential subdomain permutations.
  - **Blazing Fast Performance**: Executes enumeration tools in **parallel**, dramatically reducing scan time.
  - **Smart & Efficient Workflow**: Features an intelligent resolution engine. It avoids re-resolving domains already confirmed by brute-force or permutation, running `dnsx` only on the remaining passive-only results.
  - **Polished User Experience (v2.7)**: A modern, clean interface with spinners, color-coded output, and a clear summary keeps you informed at every stage.
  - **Verbose Mode**: A `-v` flag to disable spinners and see the raw output from all underlying tools for debugging.
  - **Dependency Check**: Automatically verifies that all required tools are installed before running to prevent mid-scan failures.
  - **Safe & Simple**: Written in pure Bash with no complex installation required. Just clone and run\!

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

FindSubDs is a Bash script and doesn't require compilation, but you need to install the open-source tools it relies on.

**1. Clone the Repository:**

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0bl1vyx/FindSubDs/refs/heads/main/FindSubDs
chmod +x FindSubDs
```

**2. Install Dependencies:**

FindSubDs relies on a set of powerful Go-based tools. You must install: `subfinder`, `findomain`, `dnsx`, `httpx`, `puredns`, and `alterx`.

### Using Go (Recommended)

This method ensures you have the latest versions of all tools. You must have [Go installed](https://go.dev/doc/install) and configured.

```bash
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest
go install -v github.com/findomain/findomain@latest
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/dnsx/cmd/dnsx@latest
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest
go install -v github.com/d3mondev/puredns/v2@latest
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/alterx/cmd/alterx@latest
```

### Using APT (Debian/Ubuntu/Kali)

You can use `apt` to install the tools, though the versions in the official repositories may be older.

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y subfinder findomain dnsx httpx puredns alterx
```

-----

## üöÄ Usage

The script is simple to run. Provide a target domain and output files. You can add optional flags for more advanced enumeration.

**Basic Syntax:**

```bash
./FindSubDs -d <domain.com> -o <all_subs.txt> -l <live_subs.txt>
```

**Full-Featured Example:**

This runs a passive scan, brute-force, and permutation checks, all in verbose mode.

```bash
./FindSubDs -d hackerone.com -o subs.txt -l live.txt -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -r /path/to/resolvers.txt -p -v
```

### Arguments

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `-d` | **Domain** to scan for subdomains. | `-d example.com` |
| `-o` | **Output** file for all unique subdomains. | `-o all_domains.txt` |
| `-l` | **Live** output file for reachable (HTTP/HTTPS) subdomains. | `-l live_hosts.txt` |
| `-w` | **(Optional)** Path to a **Wordlist** for `puredns` brute-forcing. | `-w common.txt` |
| `-r` | **(Optional)** Path to a file of **Resolvers** for `puredns`. | `-r resolvers.txt` |
| `-p` | **(Optional)** Run subdomain **Permutations** with `alterx`. | `-p` |
