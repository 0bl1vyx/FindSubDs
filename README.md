## ‚ú® Features

-   **Multi-Source Enumeration**: Aggregates results from multiple industry-standard tools (`Subfinder`, `Assetfinder`, `Findomain`, `Sublist3r`) and data sources (`crt.sh`, `Web Archive`) for maximum coverage.
-   **Blazing Fast Performance**: Executes all enumeration tools in **parallel**, dramatically reducing scan time.
-   **Smart & Efficient Workflow**: Resolves found domains with `dnsx` before probing for live hosts with `httpx`, ensuring that only valid domains are checked.
-   **Polished User Experience**: A modern, clean interface with spinners, color-coded output, and a clear summary keeps you informed at every stage.
-   **Dependency Check**: Automatically verifies that all required tools are installed before running to prevent mid-scan failures.
-   **Safe & Simple**: Written in pure Bash with no complex installation required. Just clone and run!
